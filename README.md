## Introduction API (Application Programming Interface)
### General Overview
Connectivity is an amazing thing, by now we're all used the instant connectivity that puts the world at our fingertips from desktop or devices. We can purchase, post, pin, and pick anything, anywhere, **_but how does it happen? how does data get from here to there? how do different devices and applications connect with each other?_** The unsung hero of our connected world is **Application Programming Interface** or **API**

In basic terms, **APIs just allow applications to communicate with one another**. When people speak of **“an API”**, they sometimes generalize and actually mean “a publicly available web-based API that returns data, likely in JSON or XML”.  The API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that governs the **_access point(s)_** for the server. To speak plainly an **_API_** is the messenger that takes request and tells the system what you want to do, and then returns the response back to you.

Think of an **API** like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to. **_But what's missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table_**
In this Documentation we will focus on these specific kinds of APIs, how client request data and how server response.
