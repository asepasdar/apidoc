## Introduction
### General Overview, what is API (Application Programming Interface)?
In basic terms, **APIs just allow applications to communicate with one another**. When people speak of **“an API”**, they sometimes generalize and actually mean “a publicly available web-based API that returns data, likely in JSON or XML”.  The API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that governs the **_access point(s)_** for the server.
